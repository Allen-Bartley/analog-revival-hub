# Analog Revival Hub

### Modular Home Media Conversion Projects & Experiments

Welcome to my personal collection of retro-inspired media conversion setups. This repo documents a variety of hands-on projects designed to preserve, digitize, and re-experience analog content using practical hardware and home networking solutions. Whether itâ€™s streaming digitized VHS tapes to a Roku, capturing vinyl records via USB turntables, or reviving a DIY DVR system powered by an ATI All-In-Wonder card from yesteryearâ€”each project captures a piece of media nostalgia and wraps it in a modern playback experience.

## ðŸ“Ž Why This Matters

These projects come from a desire to preserve not just the content, but the comfort and context of how it was originally enjoyed. Whether it's watching family tapes in the living room, hearing vinyl in stereo, or reliving the feel of navigating old TV recordings, I aim to offer solutions that blend technological practicality with personal storytelling.
