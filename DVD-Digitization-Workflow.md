# üìÄ DVD Digitization Workflow

### *Preserving personal film archives with GPU-accelerated encoding and structured media curation.*

This module outlines my typical process for digitizing DVDs using HandBrake, with a focus on speed, quality preservation, and organizing content into a structured library for long-term access. Whether it‚Äôs discount box sets or inherited collections, I aim to create usable digital copies that respect the original source and fit neatly into my archival ecosystem.

## üß© Summary

- **Goal:** Convert physical DVDs into digitally accessible files for personal library playback and archival organization.
- **Tools Used:** HandBrake + NVIDIA NVEnc hardware acceleration
- **Source Material:** Personal collection, inherited discs, discount genre box sets (e.g., *50 Sci-Fi Classics*)
- **Philosophy:** Prioritize completeness and efficiency over unnecessary upscaling or format inflation
