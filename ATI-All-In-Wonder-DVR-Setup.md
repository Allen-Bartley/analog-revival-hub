# üñ•Ô∏è ATI All-In-Wonder DVR Setup

### *Live TV and scheduled recording with a multipurpose media card in a one-room digital oasis.*

In the mid to late 2000s, I configured my bedroom workspace to double as a media center using the ATI All-In-Wonder card. Without room for a standalone TV, this setup let me watch live broadcasts and record programs directly on my PC‚Äîbridging the gap between desktop productivity and personal entertainment in a compact footprint.

- **DVR Capability:** Recorded segments manually (due to satellite input limits).
- **TV Guide Integration:** Could download local channel schedules and automate recording (limited with satellite).
- **Audio/Video Sync:** Slight delay between mouth movement and sound‚Äînoticeable on live action but tolerable due to anime familiarity and dubbing quirks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Limitations

- Could not control the satellite box for channel switching (no IR blaster setup).
- Recording schedule automation was limited by signal source type.
- Minor A/V desynchronization inherent to analog-to-digital real-time processing.

## üìö Reflections

This was one of my first true "DIY media center" setups. It taught me how to blend hardware capabilities with practical constraints and made me appreciate how signal flow, device interoperability, and user expectations all play into a successful entertainment environment. Even though it wasn‚Äôt perfect, it was mine‚Äîand it worked.
