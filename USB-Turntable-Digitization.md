# üé∂ Digitizing Vinyl ‚Äì USB Turntable Workflow & Preservation Guide

This guide outlines the process used to digitize a 45 RPM vinyl record using a USB turntable and **Audacity** on a Windows 10 Pro system. The workflow demonstrates hardware setup, software configuration, analog-to-digital conversion, and post-editing for archival or playback purposes.

## üìÄ Equipment & Operating Environment

- **Turntable Model**: Memorex 2650MMO USB Turntable  
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 Pro  
- **Audio Software**: Audacity (open-source, multi-platform)

---

## üîå Hardware Setup & Recognition

- USB turntable connected directly to the computer.
- No additional drivers were required‚ÄîWindows 10 automatically recognized the device as a USB audio input.
- Optional AV/RCA speaker ports were available but unused in this setup.

> üìù Note: Many older turntables include driver discs. In most modern systems, these are not necessary due to native support.

## üéõÔ∏è Audacity Configuration

1. Installed Audacity (latest version available via [official site](https://www.audacityteam.org/)).
2. Selected the USB audio interface as the **Input Device**.
3. Set project rate to 44100 Hz for standard playback.
4. Verified stereo recording channel and input monitoring before capture.

## üéöÔ∏è Recording Process

- Placed a 45 RPM vinyl record onto the turntable.
- Recorded Side A and Side B separately using Audacity.
- Used the **Trim Tool** to clean the beginning and end of each recording.
- Optionally applied mild noise reduction and normalization.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to monitor input levels to avoid clipping during recording.

## üíæ Export & File Format

- Exported final recordings as `.wav` for lossless archival.
- Additional `.mp3` conversion performed for casual playback if needed.

## ‚úÖ Summary & Value

This project demonstrates:

- Peripheral setup and driver discovery
- Analog-to-digital conversion practices
- Real-world use of open-source editing tools
- Technical awareness of sampling rates, channel configuration, and preservation formats

The process offers a reliable pathway for digitizing legacy audio formats and represents practical problem-solving using available tools. It showcases resourcefulness and technical breadth relevant to IT support and media archiving workflows.

üéµ Example Digitization:
- "Stay Near Me" ‚Äì The Florida Boys Quartet (Side A)
- "It's Not An Easy Road" ‚Äì The Florida Boys Quartet (Side B)

*Recorded from a 45 RPM vinyl using a Memorex 2650MMO USB turntable and Audacity.*
